This is the Kentucky OET Rulebase Development Tree.

It is the private Git repository for the rulebases and related documentation and deliverables; either completed, 
or as-is snapshots of development and testing branches (alpha, or beta, or candidate releases)

ToDo:  Add Branch and Merge Structural Notes.

Ultimately the only significant branch is Master, as that is 
the main tree that we will drop to the client.
