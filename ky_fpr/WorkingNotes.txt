don't use under-employed
don't use part time

Use Full Time or Less Than Full Time

Do not want to define of Good Cause

Will define Countable vs Non-Countable
Id for precedents.

Instead of lookin  definition or work time.
They want to look at wages first:
USD, fotr a specific period of time, bi-weekly,
but questions are for each week.

Payable:  80% of the Gross Income weekly difference Weekly Benefit Amount 
(from base period wages earned formula)

Page 3: Law Book - 341 030
Earning needs careful definitions, to that they have received (pensions affects).

A claim filing
is "initial" after 10 week employment
after the BYE ends from a prior claim
a second filing is treated a re-opening a claim based on the ssn and BYE, 
same separation date ???
Filing a claim
Amending a claim

The definition of EB, EUC and regular claims needs to be addressed.

Notes:
When drafting a new conclusion, one element is how many employer's must be considered as part of that rule's predicates
generally the legal definitions do not specify this clearly

This is part of the chargeability deductions, and is not directly part of the determination of qualifying/payable

While there is some legal definition of the 10week rules" some of that appears to be administrative/SOP rules.

Deferred: needs a SME Quorum.

working definition:
must have a total of 10 "weeks" of employment, since the last BYE date
we need some example scenarios as test cases

For purpose of determining the chargeable employer (not eligibility), We want MR and NMR and the 10 week employer/s.

The ten weeks do not have to be consecutive
If they work even 1 day that counts as a week.

Chargeability is related to the employers dispute period.
DCI's make a ruling as to who is chargeable.
The chargeability department sends out a "412".
